###Project Name:
*Beve* Development



###Project Description:
This will be a collab project with a team of Columbia University MBAs and fellow programmers during Summer 2015.

The project will be about developing a web app called *Beve*.
*Beve* will be an app about (Insert App description).

After the app development, the app will be launched and managed by the team. And this app will be profit-based.

###Project Timeline (Goals): 
- May to early June
⋅⋅1. Hands-on to [MEAN](http://mean.io/#!/) Stack.
⋅⋅2. Practice with developing the *Flapper News* page.
- June to July
⋅⋅1. App development.

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list


###Misc:
This web app development will be based on [MEAN](http://mean.io/#!/) Stack, HTML, and JavaScript.

####MEAN stands for
-**MongoDB**: the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable.

-**Express**: a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

-**AngularJS**: AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

-**Node.js**: a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.

####"Flapper News Tutorial"
**Link:** [Learn to Build Modern Web Apps with MEAN](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial/)

**Description:** The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through the creation of a Reddit/Hacker News clone using the MEAN stack. By completing this tutorial, you will gain a basic understanding of the MEAN stack including building a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.
