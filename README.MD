⋅⋅1. Hands-on to [MEAN](http://mean.io/#!/) Stack.
⋅⋅2. Practice with developing the *Flapper News* page.

- June to July
⋅⋅1. App development.



###Misc:

####MEAN stands for
-**MongoDB**: the leading NoSQL database, empowering businesses to be more agile and scalable.

-**Express**: a minimal and flexible node.js web application framework, providing a robust set of features for building single and multi-page, and hybrid web applications.

-**AngularJS**: AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.

-**Node.js**: a platform built on Chrome's JavaScript runtime for easily building fast, scalable network applications.

####"Flapper News Tutorial"
**Link:** [Learn to Build Modern Web Apps with MEAN](https://thinkster.io/mean-stack-tutorial/)

**Description:** The goal of this tutorial is to guide you through the creation of a Reddit/Hacker News clone using the MEAN stack. By completing this tutorial, you will gain a basic understanding of the MEAN stack including building a REST interface with Express.js on top of Node.js and using that interface to perform CRUD operations on a database via an AngularJS frontend.
